# School Portfolio Project

This project involves the creation of a personal portfolio website from scratch.

## Overview:

The portfolio website showcases various projects and serves as a platform to demonstrate skills and achievements. It was designed to be visually appealing and fully functional.

## Easteregg:

There are two Easter eggs to discover: 
the first involves typing '1337' on the site to receive a random joke, 
while the second is hidden within the header; pressing it will dynamically change the background.


## Issue Encountered:

While the website looks and operates as intended in the live preview and on Go Live on VS Code, On GitHub Pages, some issues have been observed:

    404 Error: Navigation between certain pages, such as from projects.html to cv.html, results in a 404 error.
    This issue needs to be investigated and resolved to ensure smooth navigation across all pages.

    Layout Problem: The web layout, which previously functioned correctly in the live preview and on the hosting platform, 
    is now experiencing issues.

Efforts are underway to identify the root causes of these issues and implement appropriate solutions to ensure the seamless functioning of the portfolio website.

## Update on Website Issues:

It appears that the issues with the website have resolved themselves, likely due to GitHub Pages needing additional time to settle in.

## Will make a new update:

When i fix the 404 problem or If It fixes Itself with time i will make an other update.

## Update on Website Issues: 2

The navigation issues have been resolved. Previously, the problem stemmed from the capitalization of my navigation links, 
which have now been uniformly converted to lowercase.
